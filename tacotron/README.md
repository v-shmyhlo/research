* split mel/stft
* griffin lim only for stft part
* check loss computation
* normalize spectras (per-channel)
* per sample forcing
* mean loss by C
* maximize mean entropy and minimize individual entropies
* check processed inputs
* better init
* loss mean by C
* use conv norm and linear norm everywhere
* check training performance
* cache spectrograms
